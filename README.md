Product Cards

## Motivation
The motivation behind this to give us a sense of building out the product section of an 
ecommerce site and to use flexbox to do this.

## Build status
Prototype - This is a very rough draft, and would need a lot more styling and work to be completed.
The main section consists of products that use an arrays to populate them.

## Code Style
HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox
